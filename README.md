# I have studied academic writing at my university and it was a task to perpare a grant proposal:
it was titled: 
# Deep learning models and Natural Langauge Processing on Twitter tweets to detect Online Harassment, Hate speech andÂ Cyberbullying
## A grant proposal is a request that a funder joins the nonprofit as a partner to achieve specific results. 

## During my studies, I have learnt many academic and scientific research in reading and wrinting the main parts of the publications and in summarsing the main points.
